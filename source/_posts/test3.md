the little ant's name is Peter.

one day morning, his mom asked him to get his dad back for lunch. Then he went out happily.

Gradually, Peter smelled a strange smell, he wanted to know what it is, so he went along with the strange smell. Finally he met a crowd on the road who were carrying a giant monster and walking in another direction.

One of the crowd also saw him, and said: "Come here! little boy, we need your help!"
But Peter didn't know what they were doing, and what if they were bad guys.
So he answered: "I'm sorry! Sir, I have other important things to do, I have to go, Bye"

Suddenly, Peter found dad in the crowd. He stepped forward and shouted: "dad!"
His dad noticed him: "Oh! my sweetie! mom ask you to get me back for lunch?"
"Hmm, but what are you doing? dad" Peter asked.
"well, it's time to teach you this, we are working together to carry the giant food." dad said.
"food? wow, cool!, such a giant food we could eat a long time" Peter said surprisingly.
Then dad said: "Peter, when you grow up, you also need to learn to cooperate with others to carry giant food. Because we offen meet some giant food that we can't move by ourselves. you get it?"
"emmmmm, get it!" Peter said. "emmm, that strange smell, is it uesd to inform everyone to help?"
"Oh my smart boy"

For a while, Peter and his dad returned home with distributed food.
